across the globe is crucial in identifying' 'weaknesses in any technology We want security researchers to feel comfortable' 'reporting vulnerabilities theyve discovered as set out in this policy so' 'that we can fix them and keep our information safe' 'If you believe youve found a security issue in our products or services we' 'encourage you to notify us We welcome working with you to resolve the issue' 'promptly' 'This policy describes hhooww ttoo sseenndd uuss vulnerability reports and hhooww lloonngg we ask' 'security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities Your'

vulnerability' '      dont exploit a vulnerability for gain Do not use an exploit to' '      compromise or exfiltrate data establish command line access andor' '      persistence or use the exploit to pivot to other systems Once youve' '      established that a vulnerability exists or encountered any of the' '      sensitive information outlined below please stop your test and notify us' '      immediately' '     Please keep confidential any information about discovered vulnerabilities' '      for uupp ttoo  ccaalleennddaarr ddaayyss after you have notified Arduino unless' '      mutually
